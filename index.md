## No. Cop. Money.

George Floyd was a Houstonian, and he was murdered by the police. This puts the issue of police reform at the front and center of our national poltical discourse. For far too long, institutions like the police unions have stood in the way of meaningful reform. 

In Houston, the Houston Police Officer's Union has contintinually opposed reforms that would reduce police violence. It acts primarily to protect officers from the consequences of their actions, and enables them to (violently) betray public trust and hurt the very people they are sworn to protect. 

Almost every member of the Houston City Council has taken money from the HPOU. We are asking for Houston politicians, especially "progressive" and "liberal" ones to do the following:

1. Vow not to take HPOU money in the future. 
2. Donate the money they have already taken. 
3. Oppose the further militarization of the police.
